# in this section we will lear what are ques and how to creat them using python lists and python linked list
# and we will implement various operations such as: Enqueue() - Dequeue() - piking and deleting
# Queue is a data structure that stores items in a First-in/First-out manner.
# we will use Queue Data structure when we want to implement the logic that the element which comes first will alsso be executed Firat (FIFO methode)
# and we dont have any access the data that are located in the middle of the queue and if we want to add a new element 
# to the data structure we have to add it at the end of the Quue (Exactly like a real life Queue)
