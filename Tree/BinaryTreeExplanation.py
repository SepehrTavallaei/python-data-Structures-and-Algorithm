# binary tree is a tree wich each node has the maximum children of 2 so it either has 1 2 or 0 child
# Binary tree is a family of data structure because we have several kinds of binary tree such as: (BST, Heap tree, AVL, red black trees, Syntax tree)
# Binary trees are a prerequisite for more advanced trees like BST, AVL, Red Black Trees
# more over ther are some specific problems that can be solved easily using binary tree such as: Huffman coding problem, heap priority problem and expression parsing problems can be solved efficiently using binary trees,


#kinds of Binary tree:

#1) full binary tree: it's a binary tree that only has nodes with 0 or 2 children
#2)perfect binary tree: all nodes have 2 leap nodes have 2 children note that all leaf nodes should be located in the same level and all the parent nodes should have 2 children 
#3) balanced binary tree: each node should not be more that a certain distance to the root node
