#Arrays are not built in to the python so instead we use lists which they are more flexibl.
#we can use Arrays in python using Array module or NumPy Array module how ever there are some things that you need to consider before using this data type
# - Each element in Arrays has a unique index
# - Arrays can store data of specified type for example if an Array stores integers it can not stor strings or booleans
# -  Elements of an array are located in a contiguous (they located next to each other and there is no gap between them)

#why do we need arrays?
# lets assume that we want to store tree integers we can assign three variable to each one but what if we want to assign 500 numbers? well we use Arrays so essentially arrays are used to store a collection of data with the same type (usually with the same type).


#types of Array:
# there are two types of array depending on the number of dimenstion : 1) one dimesion 2) multi dymension
# we use indexes to access elements in one dimensional Arrays
