# what is a stack?
#stack is a data structure that stores items in a Last-in/First-Out manner.
# imagine we locate lots of plates on each other and we wana remove 1 to the last plates we can not remove it directly we should remove the last plate (the plate which is on top) at first then the plate that we intend to remove
#it is simmilar to the browsing history (the back buttom of the browser) we can not access the first web site directly we should come backwards from the last to the first;

# stack operations:
# -Create Stack
# - Push
# - Pop
# -Peek
# - isEmpty
# - isFull
# -deleteStack

#there are various ways of implementing stack but in this course we will create stack using 3 ways:
# using list without size limit
# using list with size limit
# using linked list
